# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

### Background
The dataset contains information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers for a company that sells drinks. The transactional data shows which offer customers responded to, and what the customer ended up buying. Some attributes of the offers refer to the variety, the discout, the minimum quantity or the country of origin.

### Analysis
In the mini-project we use differing cluster techniques for unsupervised data such as K-Means, PCA, Affinity Propagation or Spectral Clustering to find patterns in the customer bying behavior.
